Since we have already setup the environment, it is time to get our hand wet. For programming learning the first class is always hello world, but the "hello world" program for solana is far more complicate than what you might think about.
For lots programming language the "hello world" might be a print statement and it is done, but for "hello world" of solana, we need to capture all keypoints of solana development, when you complete the "hello world" case, you are all most
half way on the graduation.

Let's using command "anchor init hello_world" to generate an empty project, then go into ./hello_world/program/hello_world/lib.rs, as you can see, the compilation result of the project would be a library instead of a excutable. We will go into
the details of the project structure in later section, for now we can see the project is made of two kinds of files, one is "rs" file which is used for rust code, the other is "ts" file, which is typescript code, let's focus on the part of
rust first.

In order to understand the design logic of solana program, we need something we may familiar as a ladder to climb into the realm of solana program. Think about how you design a backend system for banking service which can enable user to
register, transfer fund in which is increasing the balance and transfer fund out which is decreasing the balance. We will take a design patter which is like micro-service, we should have a backend service component which providing restful
api endpoint:

1, register, which enable user to create an account by receiving user name and password of user, and receive a small amount of fund such as 1 penny to active his/her account, then return an token to the endpoint caller.

2, increase_balance, which receive the token and given amount of fund from user, the token is generated by the register endpoint and used to verify the identity of user, and the number is used to indicate the increase amount of balance.

3, decrease_balance, which receive the the token which is used to verify the identity of the user and a number to inidcate the amount need to reduce from the balance.

we also need other kind of service, one is the database service, this service will hold info about the given user, when user call register endpoint, the database service will create a record to save info about the user, such as name,
sex, and especially the balance info. We also need one service which can be name system program, it is responsible for executing business logic, for example, when api endpoint register is called, the backend service will transfer the
user name and password to the system program, and the latter will generate a token and ask the endpoint returns the token back to user.
